aptpac is a program which helps with the transition to Arch Linux and Arch based distros like Manjaro.

It simplifies using pacman as it works like the easier to use APT package manager found in Debian based distributions.

The program comes in 2 variants, a bash shell version, and a C code variant.
It is recommended to use the C code variant since C code is quicker and better than shell scripts. the C variant is more friendly and more feature rich, but the bash version gets new commands before as its simpler and easier to debug.

## Note
This program has nothing to do with the other projects named `aptpac` like [this one](https://github.com/FascodeNet/aptpac). please don't ask for support for other `aptpac`'s in this repository or ask for support for this `aptpac` in the other `aptpac`'s repositories.

## Installation

Since there are 2 variants of aptpac, there are 2 install methods, please choose the variant you would like:

1) C (recommended)<br>
2) Bash

### Guide to installing C aptpac:

``` bash
sudo pacman -S cmake make git gcc
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/aptpac
cd ./aptpac/C-edition
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCALLCOMMAND="aptpac" ..
make
# Optional however crucial
sudo make install # This moves aptpac to /usr/local/bin so it can be run easily
```
#### Learning mode (C-edition only)
If you want to enable 'learning mode' which prints the commands being run, add  `-DLEARN=1` before the .. in the `cmake` line during installation so it looks like this:<br>
```bash
cmake -DLEARN=1 -DCALLCOMMAND="aptpac" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

### Guide to installing Bash aptpac:

``` bash
sudo pacman -S wget
cd $HOME
mkdir ~/.aptpac
wget https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/aptpac/releases/download/2.2/aptpac.sh -O ~/.aptpac/aptpac.sh
chmod +x .aptpac/aptpac.sh
echo "alias aptpac=\"~/.aptpac/aptpac.sh\"" >> $HOME/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Reviews

<a href="https://github.com/CleanMachine1" target="_blank">CleanMachine1</a> - aptpac is a great piece of software, making the move to arch easier (the better Linux in my opinion).
